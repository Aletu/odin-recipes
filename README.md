# odin-recipes

This repository simulates a cookbook with multiple recipes.

The objective of this project is to practice basic HTML functionalities.

These include:

- Links
- Headers
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Images

An effort was made to follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and to do them relatively frequently to practice a structured and easy-to-follow approach to commits.
